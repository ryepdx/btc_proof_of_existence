# btc_proof_of_existence
A bash script to generate a Bitcoin address from a document, allowing one to establish proof of existence (and possession) at a particular point in time by sending some bitcoin to the generated address from an address one controls.

Requires [rhash](https://github.com/rhash/RHash) and [xxd](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/xxd1.html), the latter of which comes packaged with [Vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php).
